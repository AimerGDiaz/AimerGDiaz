 I am a Biologist and M.Sc. Bioinformatics from the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/).   <br>
 Currently I am a PhD student at the Department of Plant Biology at [SLU](https://www.slu.se/),   <br> 
 working in [Dr. Hafr√©n's lab](https://andershafren.wixsite.com/website) on in Plant-Virus Molecular interactions.   <br>
 My Ph.D. research focuses on how plant viruses manipulate Arabidopsis's post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms,  <br>
 including RNA interference machinery, Stress granules, and Translational regulation.
